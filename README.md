# Responsive Web Design

I have learned to write well-formed markup in HTML by understanding proper content structuring using sectioning elements, creating navigation systems, and validating markup using standard tools. Additionally, I have gained proficiency in constructing web layouts using CSS, including the use of selectors, understanding the CSS box model, and employing cascade, inheritance, and specificity principles. Furthermore, I have acquired the skills to build HTML web pages with styled elements using CSS, including styling basics, applying properties, and designing and styling forms. Moreover, I have learned to construct and deploy web pages onto a web server, utilizing design-comp files for layout and styling and deploying sites live on the internet. Lastly, I have adopted an effective workflow for web design and development, incorporating standard tools, following given build workflows, and utilizing a 960px center page layout framework.
